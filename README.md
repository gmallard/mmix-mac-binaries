## OS X (MAC) MMIX Binaries

If you are interested in MMIX, work with a recent Mac, but can not build
the runtime executables, here they are.

### Latest Build Environment

The latest build is from the 2016/08/04 MMIX update.

Build environment is:

    ProductName:    Mac OS X
    ProductVersion: 10.12.3
    BuildVersion:   16D32

### Build Environment

Built on a very new Mac at the time of publishing, 10.7.1 out of the box.  Info - uname -a shows:

* Darwin hotmacma 10.7.1 Darwin Kernel Version 10.7.1: Mon Jan 31 14:55:53 PST 2011; root:xnu-1504.10.48~4/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

### Building Yourself

A rough outline of my procedure:

* Build tools are from Xcode 4.  Install that first.
* Install cweb and ctangle.  Get the source from literateprogramming.com.  Read the README carefully and follow instructions.
* Put the cweave/ctangle binaries in your PATH.
* Get the MMIX source code. http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/mmix-news.html.
* Follow the intructions in the README.
